<h2> :pencil: Project Description </h2>

<p align="justify"> 
Predictive maintenance is transforming aviation by leveraging machine learning to anticipate failures and optimize engine performance. This project focuses on accurately estimating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of aircraft turbofan engines using sensor data, enabling proactive maintenance to prevent costly downtime and catastrophic failures. By applying advanced regression and deep learning techniques, we analyse degradation patterns to enhance operational efficiency, reduce maintenance costs, and improve safetyâ€”critical for an industry where engine reliability impacts millions of dollars and lives. The solution not only extends engine longevity but also contributes to the economic sustainability of airlines in a highly competitive and regulated sector.
